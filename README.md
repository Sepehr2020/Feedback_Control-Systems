This repository includes a project done for “Feedback Control Systems” course at Simon Fraser University.


Course Description: This course is an introduction to the analysis, design, and applications of continuous time linear control systems. Topics include transfer function representation of open and closed loop systems, time domain specifications and steady state error, sensitivity analysis, time and frequency response, and stability criteria. It includes a treatment of methods for the analysis of control systems based on the root locus, Bode plots and Nyquist criterion, and their use in the design of PID, and lead-lag compensation. Lab work is included in this course.
